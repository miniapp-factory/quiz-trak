```
A quiz that allows someone to find out which animal (cat, dog, fox, hamster, horse) they are most similar to by answering 5 multiple choice questions and be able to share result. Generate an image for each animal in a cute cartoon vector style and display it on the result page. Allow the user to retake the quiz as many times as they want. Write the questions and answers yourself. Randomize the order of the answers for each question.

Place the quiz on the home page.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

The following files in your repository are the ones that will most likely need to be edited to implement the requested quiz functionality, generate the app logo, and update the app metadata:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – to place the quiz on the home page and display the result.
2. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app title and description.
3. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate the new app logo image.
